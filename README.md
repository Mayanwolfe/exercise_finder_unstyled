# Excercise Finder App (Unstyled Version)

This app was built as an educational exercise on my stream on 05/11/2025.
It uses only HTML and Javascript, with Supabase as the backend database.
If you want the version of this app that is styled with Bootstrap, go here: LINK TBD

You are welcome to fork this code to use for your own projects or portfolio.

Thanks to https://github.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db for providing the raw JSON exercise data that was used in this app.
